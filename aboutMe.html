        When I was in class 6, I was introduced to QBasic and DOS and it caught my attention. Ever since then I got hooked to programming. The first time when I created a website using HTML, it made me very happy and I learnt the power of computer languages. It became something that I enjoy and want to do for life. It also helped that my elder brother is also interested in computer programming and we talk about the power of different computer languages and their frameworks. Since secondary school I learnt BASIC, HTML, DOS commands, MySQL, Python, C, C++, CSS, Data Structures.



    </p>
    <p>        This passion carried me to pursue a degree in CSE. Here there are more resources available to me than I ever could have imagined as a kid. I studied new languages, problem solving, higher mathematics, all with pretty much the same fascination that drove me as a kid. And it was here that I learned truly how much there was yet to learn.
    </p>
    <p>        So, now every day I am learning something new and revising concepts that I learnt in the past. There's certainly yet more to learn, yet more problems to solve, and yet more to build. And for this, I am very grateful.
